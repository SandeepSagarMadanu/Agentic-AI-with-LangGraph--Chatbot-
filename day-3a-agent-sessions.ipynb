    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

Generative AI models (like those based on GANs or transformers) can design entirely new molecules from scratch with desired properties, such as binding affinity, solubility, and low toxicity. Companies are using this to create novel small molecules and even peptides.\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're interested in the **\"Novel Molecule Design and Optimization\"** aspect of AI in drug discovery. That's a fantastic area to delve into because it's where AI is truly acting as a creative partner for scientists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a more detailed look at how AI is revolutionizing the design and optimization of new drug molecules:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Drug Design: Creating the Unseen**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Imagine AI as an incredibly skilled chemist who can invent entirely new chemical structures. Generative AI models learn the \"rules\" of chemistry and biology from vast datasets of existing molecules and their properties. They can then generate novel molecules that have never been synthesized before but are predicted to have specific therapeutic effects.\n",
      "*   **How it works (Simplified):**\n",
      "    *   **Learning the Language of Molecules:** Models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are trained on datasets of known drug molecules. They learn the relationships between chemical structures and their biological activities, properties (like solubility, stability), and even toxicity.\n",
      "    *   **Generating New Structures:** Once trained, these models can be guided to generate new molecules. You can provide specific criteria, such as \"design a molecule that binds strongly to protein X and is orally bioavailable,\" and the AI will propose novel structures that meet those requirements.\n",
      "    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Sometimes, reinforcement learning is used. The AI proposes a molecule, it's \"tested\" (virtually) for its properties, and if it's not good enough, the AI gets feedback and tries again, learning to make better suggestions over time.\n",
      "*   **Key Advantages:**\n",
      "    *   **Exploration of Vast Chemical Space:** The number of possible drug-like molecules is astronomically large. AI can efficiently explore this space, finding candidates that humans might not even conceive of.\n",
      "    *   **Speed:** Designing and synthesizing molecules traditionally takes years. AI can generate promising candidates in a matter of weeks or months.\n",
      "    *   **Novelty:** AI can create truly novel scaffolds (the core structure of a molecule) that could lead to new classes of drugs with different mechanisms of action.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. De Novo Drug Design: Building from Scratch**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** This is closely related to generative AI. \"De novo\" means \"from the beginning.\" AI models are used to design molecules from scratch, without being overly constrained by existing drug structures.\n",
      "*   **Focus:** The focus is on creating molecules that are not just variations of known drugs but could potentially address unmet medical needs in entirely new ways.\n",
      "*   **Example:** Imagine designing a drug to inhibit a protein that has a very unusual binding pocket. AI can be trained to understand that pocket's geometry and chemical properties and then design a molecule that precisely fits and disrupts its function.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Lead Optimization: Polishing the Diamond**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Once a promising \"lead compound\" is identified (often through initial AI screening or traditional methods), AI is used to refine it. This is like taking a rough diamond and polishing it to make it shine.\n",
      "*   **How it works:**\n",
      "    *   **Predicting Property Changes:** AI models can predict how small modifications to a molecule's structure will affect its key properties. For example, if a molecule is poorly soluble, AI can suggest modifications to increase its solubility without compromising its binding to the target.\n",
      "    *   **Minimizing Off-Target Effects:** AI can predict potential interactions with other biological molecules in the body, helping to design drugs that are more selective and have fewer side effects.\n",
      "    *   **Improving Pharmacokinetics (ADMET):** AI is used to optimize Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties, ensuring the drug can be delivered effectively to its target, stays in the body long enough to work, and is safely eliminated.\n",
      "*   **Example:** If a lead compound is metabolized too quickly by the liver, AI can suggest adding or changing specific chemical groups to slow down its breakdown, extending its therapeutic effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Companies and Technologies Leading the Way:**\n",
      "\n",
